# This is a list of one-line summaries of our supported drivers.  The
# first word is the DOS driver name; the rest of the line is a
# human-readable description.  To add support for a network card,
# download the NDIS2 driver (.dos extension) from the card's
# manufacturer, copy it to the drivers/ subdirectory, and add a line
# to this file.  Then just type "make".
